=================

This kata is about test-driving [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

There are some interesting challenges encountered in my first couple of attempts:

* [Attempt #1](https://github.com/jbrunton/game-of-life-kata/pull/1)
* [Attempt #2](https://github.com/jbrunton/game-of-life-kata/pull/2)

I hope to attempt this for a third time soon.
